			Welcome to Books R Us, your number one source for all things books, e-books, articles and all your favorite reading materials. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of literatue, with a focus on productability, seamlessness, and resourcefulness
				Founded in 2022 by Mr. Jan Majed Shahata, Books R Us has come a long way from its beginnings in a Learning Resource Center. When Mr. Shahata first started out, his/her passion for providing readers with a plethora of books to choose from because of his love for reading all kinds of books may it be fictional or non-fictional, documented or researched drove him to work hard and quit his college degree, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over United States, and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky wing of the book industry.
				
				<br><br>We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
				
				<br><br>Sincerely,
				Shahata, Jan Majed T., CEO of Books R Us 2022 All Rights Reserved.</li>
